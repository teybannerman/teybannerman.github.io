# The necessary evolution: why yesterday's design leader won't survive tomorrow

Let's start with some uncomfortable truths:

- Tech companies have laid off thousands of designers in the past 18 months
- AI tools are already generating UI components, user flows, and entire design systems
- Design budgets are shrinking while AI investments balloon
- Many celebrated "design-led" companies have quietly demoted design leadership from the C-suite

The evidence suggests design leadership as we've known it is on life support. And yet...

The need for human-centered innovation has never been greater. The complexity of our challenges has never been higher. The potential for design to shape not just products but entire systems has never been more apparent.

The diagnosis isn't that design leadership is dying - it's that yesterday's design leadership model simply cannot survive tomorrow's realities.

Ten years ago, leaders typically focused on 4-5 critical issues at any one point in time. Today, that number has doubled to 9.5.

Yet somehow we expect the same leadership models, mindsets and methods to handle twice the complexity. It's like trying to run modern software on a computer from 2014 - technically possible but painfully inefficient and ultimately unsustainable.

## The uncomfortable truth about design leadership today

When I began my career, a design leader needed mastery of craft, team management, and enough business acumen to negotiate for resources. The rest could be delegated or diffused through carefully constructed processes.

That era is emphatically over.

The evolving landscape around us demands an equally profound evolution in how we lead. The evidence is everywhere if we're willing to see it.

## From pixels to purpose: the expanding role

Our tools have transformed dramatically. The UXTools annual survey shows how rapidly our design toolsets have expanded and shifted.

And that was before generative AI entered the chat. Recent data shows 83% of creatives have already experimented with AI tools in their work, fundamentally changing what's possible, who can do what, and how fast.

As our tools evolve from enablers of execution to partners in creation, the design leader's role must evolve from craft master to possibility orchestrator.

## The human cost we're not talking about

Meanwhile, below the surface of productivity metrics and delivery schedules, there's a human cost that's becoming impossible to ignore.

[CHART: Burnout quadrant showing 49% "stretching", 13% "drowning", 29% "faring well", 9% "managing"]
[LINK: McKinsey's Well at Work study]

Nearly half our teams are "stretching" - functioning well but not coping well, overwhelmed by work stressors. Another 13% are "drowning" - both underperforming and overwhelmed. Only 29% are truly thriving.

And the primary culprit isn't workload or complexity - it's toxic workplace behaviour, which research shows is the biggest driver of negative workplace outcomes.

The design leader who can't create psychological safety while navigating complexity won't have a team left to lead.

## Generation shift: the myths and realities

By next year, Generation Z will account for 27% of the global workforce, bringing different expectations, working styles, and values into our teams.

[LINK: Zurich 'Future of work' study, February 2024]

But the real story isn't just the rise of Gen Z - it's that for the first time in history, our teams routinely include 4-5 generations working side by side. From Baby Boomers to Generation Alpha, the diversity of perspectives, expectations, and working styles has never been greater.

[LINK: McKinsey "Gen-What: Debunking age-based myths" article]

McKinsey's research challenges the simplistic narratives we tell about generational differences. While Gen Z does indeed prioritize purpose and meaning over pure compensation, they still value adequate compensation and workplace flexibility. The difference isn't what they want but how willing they are to leave when they don't get it.

[CHART: "What makes people stay in their job" visualization]

As the Deloitte Global Millennial Survey shows, younger generations are significantly less tolerant of toxic workplace behaviors and poor management practices. They expect companies to have a positive impact not just on their careers, but on society.

What this means for design leadership is profound: the command-and-control approaches that might have been tolerated by previous generations simply won't fly with the new generation of talent. The days of "paying your dues" through grueling hours and thankless tasks are over - not because young designers are lazy, but because they're wise enough to recognize that there are better ways to work and learn.

## The four evolutions every design leader must embrace

As the old saying goes, "Change happens when the pain of staying the same is greater than the pain of change." For design leadership, we've reached that tipping point.

The evolution needs to happen across four critical dimensions:
1. How we create value
2. How we show up
3. How we organise
4. What we focus on

Let's unpack each one.

## Evolution 1: beyond competition, to co-creation

The first shift involves moving from creating value through competitive differentiation to unlocking value through collaborative creation.

As one Financial Services Design Director put it: "The purpose of design is to unlock the creative potential of the organisation."

This isn't just philosophical - it's practical. When designers help design the business itself - its processes, ways of working, and business models - the entire business performs better.

[CHART: Yesterday/Today/Tomorrow design leadership positioning showing evolution from separated functions to integrated co-creation]

Yesterday's design leader defended territory and fought for a seat at the table. Tomorrow's design leader doesn't need a seat because they're helping build a better table.

## Evolution 2: beyond expectations, to wholeness

The second evolution involves how we show up as leaders - moving beyond performance expectations to embracing human wholeness.

[CHART: Leadership behaviors diagram highlighting the four behaviors that account for 89% of leadership effectiveness]
[LINK: McKinsey Organizational Health Index]

Research shows that just four kinds of behavior account for 89% of leadership effectiveness:
1. Solving problems effectively
2. Operating with a strong results orientation
3. Seeking different perspectives
4. Supporting others

Notice what's not on the list: technical brilliance, charismatic presentations, or strategic genius. The most effective leaders focus on bringing people together to solve problems that matter.

In an industry obsessed with pixel-perfect execution, perhaps the most radical act is prioritising people over perfection.

## Evolution 3: beyond command, to collaboration

Traditionally, design teams have been structured like everything else in business: a pyramid. Big dogs at the top barking orders, hungry pups at the bottom fetching pixels and hoping for scraps of recognition. Middle managers in between translating barks into actionable tasks.

This hierarchical structure made sense in a world of relatively stable requirements and technologies. It ensured quality control, maintained brand consistency, and created clear career paths. For decades, it was simply How Things Were Done.

But the pyramid is crumbling under the weight of today's challenges.

When requirements change weekly, technologies emerge monthly, and business models pivot quarterly, rigid hierarchies become innovation bottlenecks. When teams need to adapt rapidly to shifting contexts, the lag time between front-line discovery and executive decision becomes unsustainable.

[CHART: Team comparison table with cycling/relay/rowing models]
[LINK: Harvard Business Review article on team structures]

Rather than one fixed structure, effective design leaders now need to operate across three team archetypes:

- **Cycling teams**: Flexible structures where members maintain significant individual autonomy while contributing to collective success. Perfect for exploration and innovation where the path forward isn't clear.

- **Relay teams**: Sequentially-organised, where success depends on both individual excellence at each stage and precise coordination. Ideal for known processes with clear handoffs.

- **Rowing teams**: Highly integrated with success depending on synchronised effort and collective performance. Essential for high-stakes deliveries with tight deadlines.

The mark of tomorrow's design leader isn't mastery of a single team model, but the ability to shift between models based on the challenge at hand - sometimes even running different models simultaneously for different workstreams.

This isn't just organizational theory - it's survival strategy. In a world where adaptability trumps efficiency, the pyramid is simply too slow, too rigid, and too disconnected from the front lines of user interaction to compete.

## Evolution 4: beyond outcomes, to impact

The final evolution involves what we focus on - shifting from metrics and outcomes to genuine impact.

[CHART: Side-by-side questions comparison showing the evolution of leadership questions]

Yesterday's design leader asked:
- What legacy will I leave?
- What are my "non-negotiable" expectations of others?
- Who on my team will complement my skills?
- What is broken that needs fixing?
- How will I get the organisation on board with my vision?
- How will I know if I'm successful?

Tomorrow's design leader asks:
- What organisational purpose do I serve?
- What does my org & team need me to be?
- What conditions will I need to put in place to maximise my team's success?
- How will we respect our past while disrupting our future?
- How will I engage the organisation in creating our shared vision?
- How will we know if we're winning?

The shift is subtle but profound - from individual achievement to collective purpose, from personal vision to shared direction, from fixing what's broken to building what's possible.

## From MPMD to HCVA: the new design leader archetypes

These four evolutions together represent a fundamental shift in the archetype of design leadership:

From:
- Manager
- Planner
- Professional
- Director

To:
- Human
- Catalyst
- Visionary
- Architect

This isn't just semantic wordplay. It's a recognition that yesterday's design leader - however skilled, however respected - simply won't survive tomorrow's challenges.

## But can this really work?

Let's be honest - this evolution isn't easy. Established organizations have built-in resistance to changing leadership models. Current design leaders may lack some of the skills needed for this new paradigm. And the very real pressures of quarterly results can make long-term transformation feel like a luxury.

But evolution doesn't require revolution. I've xxxdd. with these concrete steps:

1. **Implement 30-day design sprints focused on business processes, not just products**
   Create a cross-functional team with explicit permission to redesign one internal process that frustrates customers. Give them resources, authority, and a 30-day deadline.

2. **Establish weekly "creative dialogue" sessions between design and finance/strategy teams**
   Schedule structured 60-minute sessions where design leaders and business leaders jointly examine metrics, challenge assumptions, and identify opportunities. Document decisions and revisit progress bi-weekly.

3. **Create a "team structure pilot" for your next major project**
   Explicitly design one team as a "cycling team," another as a "relay team," and another as a "rowing team." Assign similar projects and compare results on speed, quality, and team satisfaction.

4. **Implement "question swaps" in leadership meetings**
   Replace "What's broken that needs fixing?" with "What becomes possible if we imagine something better?" in meeting agendas. Document how this shift changes the conversation and decisions.

5. **Build a "possibility scorecard" alongside your performance metrics**
   Add 3-5 forward-looking metrics to every reporting cycle that measure potential rather than just performance. Track these over time to show the impact of more evolved leadership approaches.

## The ultimate question

The competitive landscape, workplace expectations, and technological capabilities will continue evolving whether we do or not. The only question is whether we'll evolve deliberately or be forced to change reactively.

As you reflect on your own leadership approach, consider: which aspects of the old model are you holding onto that might be holding you back? And which dimensions of the new model feel most uncomfortable - yet necessary - to embrace?

Because in design leadership, as in design itself, the most powerful question isn't "Is this good enough?" but rather "What becomes possible if we imagine something better?"
