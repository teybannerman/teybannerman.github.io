"International bestselling author..."

That's apparently what I need to call myself now. I kept this one quiet, but last week "The AI Revolution: Thriving Within Civilization's Next Big Disruption" - a book I co-authored (my first!) - was published globally... and then reached #1 on the Amazon AI book charts in multiple countries 👀🙌

Naturally, I googled "how to look like a serious author". I think I nailed the brief pretty well.

I had the honour of writing the opening chapter for this incredible collection of insights from some of the most brilliant minds around the world.

My chapter, “AI: Thoughtfully enhancing human capabilities“, maps the paths and patterns of AI success I've witnessed across industries and continents - from bookshops in London to boardrooms in NYC.

Critics are already saying my writing combines "the lyrical beauty of Shakespeare, the insight of Einstein, and the self-awareness & modesty of Kanye West".

It’s available now on Amazon globally, and for the next 72 hours, you can buy the Kindle/PDF version for a special launch price cheaper than what it costs the planet every time you say “thank you” to ChatGPT.

But there's a catch. I'm holding the Amazon link hostage until this post hits 100 comments or 500 likes. Yes, I'm essentially ransoming my own book 😈.

Unlock conditions:

- 30 reposts = I share my hilariously awful first draft opening line
- 100 comments = Book link gets set free
- 500 likes = Book link also gets set free (multiple paths to victory)
- 2000 likes = I'll do a dramatic reading of my chapter at the The AI Furnace 🧨 AI Hot 100 Summit on June 26th (in a robot voice)
- 5000 likes = I update my LinkedIn bio to just say "Author"
- Someone comments only "No." = I'll question my life choices publicly

🫶

And despite my brilliant jokes, I’m actually really proud of myself. Thank you mum and dad.
