"International bestselling author..."

That's apparently what I need to call myself now. I kept this one quiet, but last week "The AI Revolution: Thriving Within Civilization's Next Big Disruption" - a book I co-authored (my first!) - was published globally... and then reached #1 on the Amazon AI book charts in multiple countries 👀🙌

I had the honour of writing the opening chapter for this incredible collection of insights from some of the most brilliant minds around the world.

My chapter, “AI: Thoughtfully enhancing human capabilities“, maps the paths and patterns of AI success I've witnessed across industries and continents - from bookshops in London to boardrooms in NYC.

Critics are already saying my writing combines "the lyrical beauty of Shakespeare, the insight of Einstein, and the self-awareness & modesty of Kanye West".

It’s available now on Amazon globally, with the Kindle/PDF version available for a special launch price cheaper than what it costs the planet every time you say “thank you” to ChatGPT.

And despite my brilliant jokes, I’m actually really proud of myself. Thank you mum and dad.
