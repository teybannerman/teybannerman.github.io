LinkedIn just named me one of their [top 12 AI voices to follow in Europe](https://lnkd.in/e2veUGFb).

I'm genuinely honoured. Also mildly offended they didn't mention my exceptional humility or the fact that I look great in a turtleneck. But I'll let that slide.

In the spirit of actually earning this recognition though, I've created something practical: a mini-guide to understanding the limitations of your favourite AI tools like ChatGPT, and using them to sharpen your thinking instead of doing your thinking. Based on pattern recognition from building AI systems and understanding how these models actually operate under the hood.

It shows you where and why AI breaks down and gives you practical techniques to dramatically improve your results.

For example:

- What makes responses sound expert when they're actually generic pattern-matching
- Why important details get lost when they're buried in the middle of your conversation
- How and why AI models fill in gaps you didn't realise existed with assumptions you never made.

It's all about understanding and working skilfully with the limitations that already exist.

Use what's helpful. Skip what isn't. Tell me what I've missed or got wrong. And if you've discovered something that works better, please share it - that's how we all get better at this.
