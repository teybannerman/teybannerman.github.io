**I help organizations implement AI in ways that create genuine value.** My journey has taken me from writing code as a software engineer to leading design teams, launching digital products, and ultimately rising to Partner at McKinsey & Company, where I led the global consultancy's European design practice and AI implementation work.

**This blend of technical understanding, hands-on product design, and business acumen** gives me a distinct perspective on technology adoption. I've seen firsthand what works and what doesn't across industries and continents - from financial services to retail, from startups to global corporations.

**What sets my approach apart** is a relentless focus on solving real problems rather than chasing technological novelty. I believe the best innovations are those that enhance human capabilities without creating new dependencies, and that's the philosophy I bring to every engagement, whether I'm advising executive teams, running interactive workshops, or speaking at global conferences.

### The beliefs behind my work

<ul class="post-list">
	<li>
		<h4>1.<br/>Technology should solve real problems.</h4>
Too many innovations are solutions in search of problems. I'm drawn to technology that addresses genuine human needs and creates tangible value, rather than adding complexity or creating new forms of dependency.
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4>2. <br/>AI implementation should be grounded in human needs, not technological possibility.</h4>
Successful AI initiatives start with a nuanced understanding of user needs and organizational realities. Technology is the enabler, not the destination.
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4>3. <br/>Creativity thrives within constraints.</h4>
The most innovative solutions often emerge when resources are limited, not unlimited. AI is no exception. Constraints - whether technical, ethical, or practical - demand ingenuity.
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4>4. <br/>Ethics isn't a checkbox.</h4>
Ethical considerations should be woven into the fabric of technology development, not treated as an afterthought or compliance exercise.
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4>5. <br/>Leaders need to understand both the forest and the trees.</h4>
The most impactful innovations happen when leaders understand both the big picture and enough technical details to ask the right questions.
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4>6. <br/>Simple beats complex - every time.</h4>
Complexity is easy. Simplicity is hard. And worth it.
