I help organizations implement AI in ways that create genuine value rather than just technical showcases. My journey has taken me from writing code as a software engineer to leading design teams, launching digital products, and ultimately rising to Partner at McKinsey & Company, where I led their European design practice and AI implementation work.

This blend of technical understanding, hands-on product design, and business acumen gives me a distinct perspective on technology adoption. I've seen firsthand what works and what doesn't across industries and continents - from financial services to retail, from startups to global corporations.

What sets my approach apart is a relentless focus on solving real problems rather than chasing technological novelty. I believe the best innovations are those that enhance human capabilities without creating new dependencies, and that's the philosophy I bring to every engagement, whether I'm advising executive teams, running interactive workshops, or speaking at global conferences.

### Things I believe

#### 1. Technology should solve real problems rather than create new dependencies.
Too many innovations are solutions in search of problems. I'm interested in technology that addresses genuine human needs and creates tangible value, not just novelty that creates new dependencies.

#### 2. AI implementation should be grounded in human needs, not technological possibility.
The most successful AI initiatives start with a deep understanding of user needs and organizational context. Technology is the enabler, not the destination.

#### 3. The best design is invisible.
When something is designed well, you barely notice it - you just accomplish what you need with less friction and more delight. The same applies to AI integration.

#### 4. Creativity thrives within constraints.
The most innovative solutions often emerge when resources are limited, not unlimited. AI is no exception.

#### 5. Ethics isn't a checkbox.
Ethical considerations should be woven into the fabric of technology development, not treated as an afterthought or compliance exercise.

#### 6. Leaders need to understand both the forest and the trees.
The best digital innovation / solutions / transformations happen when leaders understand both the big picture and enough technical details to ask the right questions.

#### 7. Simple beats complex - every time.
Complexity is easy. Simplicity is hard. And worth it.
