**I help organisations of all shapes and sizes implement AI in ways that create genuine value.** My journey has taken me from writing code as a software engineer to leading design teams, launching digital products, and ultimately rising to Partner at McKinsey & Company, where I led the global consultancy's European design practice and AI implementation work.

**This blend of technical understanding, hands-on innovation, and business acumen** gives me a distinct perspective on technology adoption. I've seen firsthand what works and what doesn't across industries and continents - from financial services to retail, from startups to global corporations.

**What sets my approach apart** is a relentless focus on solving real problems rather than chasing technological novelty. I believe the best innovations are those that enhance human capabilities without creating new dependencies, and that's the philosophy I bring to every engagement, whether I'm advising executive teams, running interactive workshops, or speaking at global conferences.

## The beliefs behind my work

<ul class="post-list">
	<li>
		<h4>1 /<br/>Technology should amplify human capabilities, not replace them.</h4>
Too many innovations are solutions in search of problems. I build technology that addresses genuine human needs and creates tangible value, rather than adding complexity or creating new dependencies.
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4>2 /<br/>AI implementation begins with humans and workflows.</h4>
Successful AI initiatives start with deep understanding of how people actually make decisions, form trust, and adapt to change - not with what the technology can theoretically do.
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4>3 /<br/>The best solutions emerge from what you choose not to build.</h4>
The goal should be clarity of purpose. Sometimes complex problems demand sophisticated solutions - the skill is knowing which complexity adds value and which creates barriers..
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4>4 /<br/>Responsible AI requires practical frameworks, not just principles.</h4>
Ethical AI needs to incorporate building trust calibration systems, testing cultural intelligence, and governance that enables rather than hinders progress.
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4>5 /<br/>Leaders need to understand both the forest and the trees.</h4>
The most impactful innovations happen when leaders understand both business imperatives and enough technical detail to ask the right questions and challenge the right assumptions.
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4>6 /<br/>Success is measured in adoption, not capability.</h4>
Technical excellence matters, but adoption determines impact. The best system is the one that fits naturally into human workflows, earns trust through transparency, and delivers value people can feel.
