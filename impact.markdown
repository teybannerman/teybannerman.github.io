From concept to launch to scale. My work - from financial services to retail, from startup environments to global enterprises - covers the full spectrum of product development and transformation.

The projects featured here represent my commitment to leading teams through complex challenges while remaining hands-on with critical aspects of delivery. Each case study reflects my belief that true impact requires the ability to navigate the messy realities of implementation, scale solutions effectively, and create sustainable results that outlast initial excitement.

## Human + AI: Reimagining financial guidance together

I led the creation of a pioneering hybrid advisory platform that enhanced human financial advisors with AI-powered insights. By developing both customer-facing AI guidance and advisor tools, we created a seamless ecosystem where technology amplified human expertise. Advisors gained deeper customer understanding while clients enjoyed personalized guidance that evolved with their life needs. The results spoke volumes: 40% uplift in sales across multiple product lines and dramatically improved engagement for both advisors and customers.

## Banking on the unbanked: Creating 100,000 first-time investors

I spearheaded an "attacker" wealth management platform that disrupted Central Europe's savings-dominated market. By transforming complex investing into an intuitive, gamified experience, we turned financial novices into confident investors. The result? A platform that outperformed year-one targets by 2.5x, democratizing wealth creation in a market where less than 5% of adults had ever invested.

## Feeding 10 million: The digital delivery revolution

When digital challengers threatened to disrupt the food delivery landscape, I led a comprehensive digital experience transformation for a global food chain, scaling across 16 countries. By establishing robust design systems, data-driven decision frameworks, and seamless cross-regional coordination, we created a best-in-class platform that defended market share while opening new revenue streams. This wasn't just a technical upgradeâ€”it was a complete reimagining of how 10+ million customers interact with a beloved global brand.

I was core the building and scaling of McKinsey's groundbreaking generative AI client work, creating solutions that transformed how global clients approach personalization.
