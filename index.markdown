strapline: Design the future deliberately
---

20+ years in tech. Over half of those designing and building AI systems that solve real problems. I've launched digital businesses with millions of customers, built enterprise AI systems at global scale, and led teams that transformed how banks compete, how retailers serve customers, and how multi-national companies make decisions.

At 14, I learned to code. Started my first web development company at 15. Then systematically conquered every discipline that touches technology - from pixel-perfect user interfaces to delivering business cases in Fortune 500 boardrooms. Software engineer. Designer. Strategist. Leader.

At McKinsey & Company - the global consultancy that advises 90% of the world's largest companies - I rose to Partner and spent nine years building their digital, design and customer experience capabilities while leading AI transformations hands-on.

Before that, I led product teams at enterprises across three continents, shipping experiences for millions of users.

Before that, I cut my teeth building software at startups and digital agencies - writing code, designing interfaces, learning what works when real people interact with real systems.

Each role added another layer of understanding about what separates technology that solves real problems from technology that creates new ones. And each transition taught me something the AI conversation desperately needs: an understanding of real-world constraints and human needs.

Today, as AI reshapes every industry, I help companies separate genuine opportunities from empty promises, creating implementation approaches that deliver measurable value. My approach combines the precision of an engineer, the creativity of a designer, and the pragmatism of a business leader.
