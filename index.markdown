**I help bridge the gap between AI possibility and business reality**

Having led enterprise AI transformations at McKinsey, I now help leaders navigate enterprise strategy, achieve product-market fit, and shape AI development responsibly. Twenty years in tech - over half designing and building AI systems that drive business and human value - gives me perspective on what separates genuine opportunities from expensive promises.

As AI reshapes every industry, I am a strategic partner for AI-enabled businesses - helping companies implement approaches that deliver measurable impact. I combine the precision of an engineer, the creativity of a designer, and the pragmatism of a business leader.
