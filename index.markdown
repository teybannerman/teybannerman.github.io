strapline: Design the future deliberately
---

For twenty years, I've been translating between the world of technology and the world of human experience. What started with writing code evolved into designing products people want to use, launching experiences that drive growth, leading teams that blend creativity with practicality, and ultimately guiding global organizations through the complexities of innovation at scale.

Today, as AI reshapes every industry, I help leaders separate genuine opportunities from empty promises, creating implementation approaches that deliver measurable value. My approach combines the precision of an engineer, the creativity of a designer, and the pragmatism of a business leader.
