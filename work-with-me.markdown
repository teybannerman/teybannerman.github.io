**I help bridge the gap between AI possibility and business reality**

While most experts go deep in one domain, I connect patterns across three critical areas that determine sustainable competitive advantage: technical possibility, human reality, and business execution.

The result? AI strategies that actually drive real impact. Products and services that customers genuinely love. Digital transformations that people embrace. 

**Let's talk. 30-minute strategic discussion. No agenda, no pitch. Just exploring whether there's alignment between your challenges and my approach.**
