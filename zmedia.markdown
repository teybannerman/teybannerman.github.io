My perspectives on the future of AI, work, design, and technology come from hands-on experience leading digital product teams and creating systems that millions use, combined with strategic leadership at the highest levels of business. I bring real implementation experience to conversations that are often dominated by theory.

Interested in this perspective for your event or publication? Let's talk.

## Books & publications

**The AI Revolution: Thriving Within Civilization's Next Big Disruption** - my first co-authored book - reached #1 on Amazon AI charts globally in 2025.

In *The AI Revolution*, I examine practical AI implementation across industries, synthesizing patterns from leading AI transformations globally, and offering frameworks for organizations navigating the gap between AI possibility and organizational reality.
